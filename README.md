<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## :fire: Highlights

<b> DriveArena </b> is a simulation system that can 

* Provide closed-loop high-fidelity testing environments for vision-based driving agents.
* Dynamically control the movement of all vehicles in the scenarios.
* Generate realistic simulation using road networks from any city worldwide.
* Have a modular architecture, allowing the easy replacement of each module.

The DriveArena is pretrained on nuScenes dataset. All kinds of vision-based driving agents, such as UniAD and VAD, can be combined with <b>DriveArena</b> to evaluate their actual driving performance in the closed-loop realistic simulation environments.
