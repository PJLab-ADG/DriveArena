defaults:
  # move configs from base_encoder to under encoder_local package
  # this helps with merging the configs at a model level
  # the package name is arbitrary but should be unique within the stacks config groups
  # to avoid conflicts.
  - base_encoder@encoder_random
  # override the attention
  - /attention@encoder_random.multi_head_config.attention: random
